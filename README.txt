  Liberty supports games designed for the original GameBoy.

  Conversion of GameBoy games to the format required on the Palm device is
  done using  a simple utility that is provided with the download. You can 
  get game images anywhere on the Internet, but to get started, go here:

    http://www.vintagegaming.com/emulators/gameboyroms.html
    http://www.emuunlim.com/ROMs/gameboy.shtml

  Gambit  Studios does not endorse the illegal use of commercial games. DO 
  NOT request  illegal images  from us -  we  don't know where you can get
  them, and will not respond to your requests.

  When  using Windows, you  may  'drag and drop' a rom image on top of the 
  ROM2PDB.EXE in your Windows  Explorer, or type in 'ROM2PDB <romname.gb>'  
  from a DOS prompt, where <romname.gb> is the name of the rom file.

  Since not all GameBoy games have been  fully tested,  we recommend  that
  you test  Liberty on  the Palm OS Emulator prior to  syncing it to  your 
  device. It can be obtained here:

    http://www.palmos.com/dev/tech/tools/emulator

    and under Settings->Debug Options please uncheck the following:

       [ ] Screen Access
       [ ] Hardware Register Access
       [ ] UIMgr data access
       [ ] Proscribed function call

  Don't install games that crash on the Palm OS Emulator onto your device,
  if an error occurs then please report it to the Liberty development team
  so we can isolate the problem.

  HOW TO PLAY:
  ============

  Start  Liberty by  tapping  on the application icon in  the  application 
  launcher.  After a  short while,  you  will  be  presented with the main 
  Liberty  screen in which  you may  select  a game  and start  emulation,
  remove it from the device, or setup any configuration options.

  REGISTRATION:
  =============
 
  Liberty is shareware, the demonstration version does not allow emulation
  of GB games that are larger than 32Kb in size. To access these features, 
  a  device  identification  number  is  required  to  generate  a  unique 
  unlocking registration datafile.

  You can get to the registration screen by  selecting the 'Register' menu 
  item in the 'Game' menu.  It is very  important to ensure  that you copy
  down the device identification exactly as it is presented in this dialog
  as follows:

   45:6D:75:6C:61:74:6F:72:39 <--- generated from the "Emulator" username

  It is  very common that users copy down this information incorrectly and
  hence delay the registration process. An exact match is required for the
  restration process to succeed.

  Registration is  only $16.95  and can be purchased with a credit card at
  Gambit Studios website.  You may also purchase at PalmGearHQ either over
  the phone or Internet using your credit card.  It  is  also sold with a
  registered version of the overclocking utility  "AfterBurner" at a dis-
  counted price of $22.95.

  www.gambitstudios.com, the official website for Liberty,  handles online 
  registrations and support for this product.
